# HackWorld3

## Synopsis
HackWorld was our project for StirHack2016. My first Hackathon.
As it was our first time in a hackathon we decided to do an app to help beginners like us.

## App
The app has to screens. 

The first screen shows a list of season hackathons.
The app gets the information from the mlh.com web page. It downloads the html code and read it to do the list.
When the user click to a hackathon some information appears about the event.

The second screen shows a map with marks in all the places where hackathons are done.
Also when user clicks on of this marks all the hotels and restaurants near will appear.

##APIs we used
- Google Maps API

## Collaborators
